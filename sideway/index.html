	  				<h3 class="heading multiColor">A Bit About Me</h3>
	  				<p>Here's where the challenge presents itself. How am I going to convince you that I have what it takes to be your first hire? I feel like I should start from the beginning, with the things I can't put on my résumé.
	  				</p>
	  				<p>With no prior programming knowledge, I taught myself Objective-C and was able to build a social networking app, <a href="http://www.appszoom.com/iphone_applications/social-networking/siddytalk_htwdq.html" title="SiddyTalk">SiddyTalk</a>, using PHP and MySQL as it's backend. With the little experience I had, this was no easy feat. However, I was determined because I wanted to make this app. For example, it took me two weeks to learn how to get data from my API to a UITableView. Four months later, SiddyTalk was on the App Store for friends to download. Unfortunately, due to the fact that I attended school, I had to take down SiddyTalk because it was too much to handle. Though some people may consider SiddyTalk a failure, I see it as a humble beginning. My mentality is, “If I can build a social network with no prior programming skills, then I can build anything”. And that is exactly what I have done.
	  				</p>
	  				<p>Since then, I’ve taken numerous computer science classes to expand my knowledge in programming as well as taking on more personal projects. I have brought in an array of programming languages, full-stack development, hardware development, Machine Learning, even tools to help me design API's, e.g. <a href="http://docs.codered1.apiary.io/">CodeRED API Design</a>.

	  				<h3 class="heading multiColor">What motivates you?</h3>
	  				<p>There are few things that motivate me to work as hard as I do, and that is my <b>curiosity</b> and <b>the challenge of a project</b>. For instance, I was very curious about Machine Learning, so I decided to take it up this summer. Man am I glad I did! Machine Learning has been the biggest challenge since my early days of programming. I honestly enjoy the challenge of <u><i>not knowing what to do</i></u> because I know with time, I will not only get it, I will master it. Knowing that pushes me to continue to learn new technologies even when I feel I am not qualified to learn it.

	  				<h3 class="heading multiColor">Why this job?</h3>
	  				<p>It’s actually quite simple, given the opportunity to work with Sideway, I would be able to use my creative mind to help build a product. I don't mind sitting behind a desk all day, as long as I get to build some cool shit while I'm at it.

	  				<h3 class="heading multiColor">What does your perfect environment look like?</h3>
	  				<p>My perfect environment...hmmmm, I feel most comfortable working in my home office. I get my best work done
	  				during the night where distractions such as text messages or social media cannot disrupt my concentration.</p>
	  				<p>
	  					My current work schedule(Central Time):
	  				</p>
	  				<ul>
	  					<li>10pm-5am - Work.</li>
	  					<li>5am-10am - Sleep.</li>

	  				<h3 class="heading multiColor">Got a front end stack in mind? What is it?</h3>
	  				<p>I feel this question could be a double edged sword. I have a lot of experience with the MEAN STACK, but that’s
						not to say that Angular is the best choice for Sideway. I need to have a more in-depth understanding of Sideway
						before recommending a framework. Ultimately, it is not my decision to make, it’s for the team to decide. I have a strong understanding of MVC, so regardless if I have experience with the chosen framework or not, I feel very confident in my abilities to develop the front end.

	  				<h3 class="heading multiColor">What besides writing code are you passionate about?</h3>
	  				<p>Besides coding, another one of my passions is basketball. I even get my competitive nature from it. Basketball has
						taught me “It takes a good team with great cohesion in order to win, not just one great player”. In our case, a
						rockstar developer stands no chance against a team of good developers that trust and work well with each other.
						I see this all the time at hackathons.
	  				</p>
	  				<p>Without getting too philosophical, the second thing I am passionate about is gaining more knowledge. Whether that's learning from those who are more experienced than me, taking free courses on Coursera, or watching YouTube videos over random things like <a href="https://youtu.be/cFdCzN7RYbw" title="Science Of Persuasion">Science Of Persuasion</a>, knowledge to me is the most valuable thing a human can possess.</p>
